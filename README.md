# privacy-pump-metadata-schema

> **Maturity:** Local-only reference  
> **Supported network:** Local development only  
> **Audit status:** Publication is not an audit. No external audit is claimed.

Privacy-safe local metadata schemas and mock APIs for Privacy Pump development.

## Purpose

Defines privacy-safe mock metadata tables and authorization boundaries without production Supabase schema, policy names, service roles, or data.

## Scope

- RLS deny by default
- Metadata never grants access
- Deterministic local fixtures

## Architecture

  User[Wallet or integrator] --> Interface[Public interface]

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for component boundaries and assumptions.

## Current security status

- Experimental or reference material; not mainnet-ready.
- The inspected devnet programs are upgradeable and shared one upgrade authority at the publication audit date.
- Factory and relayer are distinct protocol roles, but a deployment may configure one signer for both.
- Production signer topology is intentionally not published.
- The ZK Pool vault-creation fee receipt does not independently bind its signer named `factory` to the Private Vault config factory; that boundary is under review.
- The ZK verifier path is fail-closed by default and is not a complete production privacy system.
- Browser, RPC, relayer, database, Waku/Logos, and Arcium metadata each have separate privacy limitations.
- Custom cryptographic glue is not described as audited.

Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before using any material.

## Dependencies

- privacy-pump-access-package-spec
- privacy-pump-security

## Local setup

Use deterministic fixtures and ephemeral local keys only. No production credentials, cloud accounts, private RPC endpoints, or real wallet relationships are required.

Repository-specific build and test commands are documented when executable source is present. Placeholder repositories run documentation and policy checks only.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add local PostgreSQL tests
- [ ] Review retention defaults
- [ ] Publish mock API schemas

## Known limitations

- Public content omits production relayer, access-control, KMS, Supabase service-role, keeper-signing, monitoring, and deployment implementations.
- Privacy depends on more than user-interface masking; metadata visible to wallets, RPCs, relayers, transports, and infrastructure remains relevant.
- Interfaces may change while the devnet architecture is stabilized.
